# Canvas Gallery with tags
Canvas Gallery is build with HTML Canvas and Vanilla Javascript.<br><br>
While it's my first time working around with Canvas and setting/drawing on the 2D Context of the canvas, it has been relatively easy to pick up and learn the logic and process behind how Canvases can be painted/drawn on easily, with the built-in main functions that already exists in JavaScript itself.<br><br>
The Web Storage is one of the great features of HTML5. With the Web Storage feature, web applications can locally store data within the browser on the client side. It stores data in the form of key/value pair on the browser.Storing data with the help of web storage is similar to cookies, but it is better and faster than cookies storage.
<br><br>
So, I choose Local storage to use in this project. Because data persist even if the browser is closed and reopened (Stores data with no Expiration).
